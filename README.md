<h1>Active Directory Home Lab Setup </h1>


<h2>Project</h2>
This project is dedicated to setting up and managing an Active Directory environment to simulate a real world enterprise network. Using virtual machines, I will deploy a Windows Server as a Domain Controller and configure various roles such as DNS, DHCP, and Group Policy Management. Workstations will be joined to the domain to test user authentication, access control, and network management tasks. This lab provides hands-on experience in managing an Active Directory infrastructure and enhances skills in system administration.
